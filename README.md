**Flare** is a dynamic, expression-oriented programming language featuring
first-class functions with closures, explicit opt-in mutability, actor-based
concurrency, and configurable sandboxing. It is primarily designed to be
suitable for embedding as a scripting language in larger applications, but can
also be used as a general-purpose programming language.

For more information about the language, installation instructions,
documentation, and more, see [flare-lang.org](https://flare-lang.org).
